# Content-analysis-of-large-sets-of-tweets-by-categories
Script developed in the Swift programming language for the analysis of large sets of tweets. Researcher(s) must define categories to classify the information contained in the tweets. The basic, discrete unit of investigation is the word (or term). The algorithm returns measures to estimate the impact of the information, based on the frequency of use of the terms and the number of retweets and likes associated with each term. Once the algorithm is applied in a set of tweets, the value of two indices will be obtained: popularity and polemicity —see Denia (2020)—.  On the other hand, the algorithm also returns two files with the co-occurrence of words (or terms) with nodes and edges arranged for visual representation in the form of a semantic network.
Note: (i) the data (set of tweets) can be previously collected through the Twitter API, for example, using a simple algorithm programmed in the R language. (ii) it is advisable to clean the text of the messages to be studied using an appropriate package -for example, tidytext R (Silge & Robinson, 2016) designed for natural language processing (NLP)—.
