# Content-analysis-of-large-sets-of-tweets-by-categories
Script developed in the Swift programming language for the analysis of large sets of tweets. The researcher can define categories to classify the information contained in the tweets. The basic, discrete unit of investigation is the word or term. The algorithm also returns measures to estimate the impact of the information, based on the frequency of use of the terms and the number of retweets and likes associated with each. Once the algorithm is applied, the value of two indices will be obtained: popularity and polemicity —see Denia (2020)—.  On the other hand, the algorithm also returns two files with the co-occurrence of words or terms with nodes and edges arranged for visual representation in the form of a semantic network.
